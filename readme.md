Demo Project Installer
======================

Installs a set of 5 do-nothing modules.


Installation
------------

- Copy the "DemoProject" directory into your site/modules subfolder.
- *Make sure the copied directory is write-enabled.* If the directory is not writeable, the demo modules install will fail.
- In the modules UI "Check for new modules."
- Click on the "DemoInstaller" link to get you to the installer module.
- Click on the "Install" button.

You should now have all 5 demo modules installed and now sign of the installer module. If the directory was not
writeable you will get an installation error. To correct: make the DemoProject folder writeable and re-run the
installer.
